### What is Memcached?

Memcached is a high-performance, distributed memory object caching system, generic in nature, but intended for use in speeding up dynamic web applications by alleviating database load. It is designed to cache data and reduce the number of times a database must be queried, thereby improving the speed and performance of applications.

### What is McRouter?

McRouter is a high-performance Memcached router developed by Facebook. It acts as a proxy between clients and Memcached servers, allowing for better load balancing and routing of requests. McRouter can be used to scale Memcached deployments efficiently, enabling applications to handle larger amounts of cached data and improving overall performance.

### Overview of Memcached, and McRouter

Memcached, and McRouter work together to provide a robust caching and database solution for high-demand applications. By utilizing Memcached for caching frequently accessed data, applications can significantly reduce response times and database load. Memcached, with its distributed architecture, ensures that data is stored reliably and can be accessed quickly, while McRouter optimizes the routing of requests to Memcached servers.

## Project Structure

- **Docker Compose Configuration**: Defines services for Memcached and McRouter.
- **Networks**: Configured for application services.

## Services

### Memcached Servers

Three instances of Memcached are configured:

1. **memcached1**
2. **memcached2**
3. **memcached3**

Each instance:
- Uses the image `memcached:latest`.
- Sets memory lock limits.
- Maps port `11211` to local ports `11212`, `11213`, and `11214`.
- Persists data in separate volumes.

### McRouter

- Image: `coozila/mcrouter:40.0.0`
- Links to the three Memcached instances.
- Command configuration for routing operations.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Getting Started

### 1. Create the Private Network

Before building the containers and images, you must manually create the `stack_private_network` Exemple:

```bash
docker network create --driver bridge stack_private_network --subnet=172.16.0.0/16
```

Alternatively, you can personalize your network according to your preferences directly in your docker-compose.yaml file like this:


```yaml

#   STACK NETWORK    ---------------------------------------------------------------#

networks:                                                                           #

    #   Private network for application services    --------------------------------#

    stack_private_network:
        driver: bridge 
        driver_opts:
            com.docker.network.enable_ipv6: "false"
        ipam:
            driver: default
            config:
                - subnet: 172.16.238.0/24
                  gateway: 172.16.238.1


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

```

> [!TIP]
> For better performance, using the host network mode is often the best choice, depending on the structure of the application in which you want to integrate the cluster. This mode can reduce latency and improve speed, but keep in mind that it may expose your services directly to the host network.
> 
> Additionally, Docker is not the most efficient for managing disk I/O. It is advisable to manage volumes on an alternative path or directly by the system, or to use another file system. This may require customization to achieve the best performance.
> 
> Depending on your specific configuration and preferences, you should choose the solution that best fits your needs. Assessing the trade-offs between ease of use, performance, and security is essential. In some cases, using the default Docker settings may be sufficient, while in others, adapting the network and volume configuration may bring significant benefits in terms of speed and operational efficiency.
> 
> Ultimately, the choice of network mode and volume management strategy should align with your application's requirements and the environment in which it will be deployed.
> 
> For more exemples see [Docker Engine Network](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/)
